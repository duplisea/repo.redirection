## Co-pilot on github

I switched over to gitlab in 2021 which has a better open-source model than github given and their use of the coding co-pilot. This may become irrelevant in the face of LLMs which are effectively doing the same thing (or at least they have been trained on open data) as co-pilot but for the moment I will work on gitlab instead.

## My gitlab projects

### [ecan.map](https://gitlab.com/duplisea/ecan.map)

is an R package that creates simple maps of eastern Canadian marine waters with various statistical areas and capability of overlaying survey tracks, etc. Almost all commands have default arguments so if called without arguments, they will usually still do something.

### [dutil](https://gitlab.com/duplisea/dutil)

is an R package that makes the benthic habitat descriptors for the Gulf of St. Lawrence easily available as R data with mapping capacities.

### [redfish.u1.advice](https://gitlab.com/duplisea/redfish.u1.advice)

an R package that calculates fishery removals for Unit 1 (Gulf of St. Lawrence) redfish that would be considered sustainable based on various methods. It calculates a quirky  quasi-parsimony score to try to determine the best method given the tradeoff between the desire for increased process information and the need to make more assumptions by doing so.
